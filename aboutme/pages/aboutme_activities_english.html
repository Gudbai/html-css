                    </header>
                    <p>Well, I'd try to get a job as a programmer and develop a game as a side project, when that game is done and I can earn a lot of money from developing games, then developing games will become my primary job. I'll also try to become a mangaka, that'd be incredibly difficult but hey, a man can dream.</p>
